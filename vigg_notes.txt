- move all subscribed events to an EventHandler class

- see if there's a .containsTag() method on NBTCompoundTag, so we can omit the label tag if it's null (instead of forcing it to always have a label)

- if duplicate waypoint clicked, then delete


Item.getNBTShareTag()
    - called every time the server automatically synchs an ItemStack to a client.  override in Item classes to modify
      the tag nbt (NOT the overall ItemStack nbt) sent to the client for each ItemStack, in case you want to strip out certain tags to effectively make them
      server-side only, or to add tags for display purposes on the client.

- next to do:

    - include recorder UUID in packet and make sure it matches heldItem's UUID before adding waypoint on server side
    
    
    - add property to Waypoint to track what world it's in
        + add validation to server to make sure all waypoints are in same world when adding a new waypoint
