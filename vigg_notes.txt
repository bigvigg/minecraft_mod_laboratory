- move all subscribed events to an EventHandler class

- see if there's a .containsTag() method on NBTCompoundTag, so we can omit the label tag if it's null (instead of forcing it to always have a label)

- if duplicate waypoint clicked, then delete


Item.getNBTShareTag()
    - called every time the server automatically synchs an ItemStack to a client.  override in Item classes to modify
      the tag nbt (NOT the overall ItemStack nbt) sent to the client for each ItemStack, in case you want to strip out certain tags to effectively make them
      server-side only, or to add tags for display purposes on the client.

- next to do:
    - extend TileEntityBeacon
        - to add additional reference to player who placed it
        - to hook into onTick and self-destruct if player not found, or player not holding waypoint recorder
            ** also, add UUID back to WaypointRecorder item, and store recorderUUID in this new TileEntity class.
               use in onTick check to also destroy waypoint if a *different* recorder is equipped
    
    - add property to Waypoint to track what world it's in
        + add validation to server to make sure all waypoints are in same world when adding a new waypoint
        
    - extend distance of ray trace to be waaaaay further
    
    - make code so that waypoints don't spawn on top of non-solid blocks
