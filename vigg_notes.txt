Item.getNBTShareTag()
    - called every time the server automatically synchs an ItemStack to a client.  override in Item classes to modify
      the tag nbt (NOT the overall ItemStack nbt) sent to the client for each ItemStack, in case you want to strip out certain tags to effectively make them
      server-side only, or to add tags for display purposes on the client.

- ideas:
    - charmed mob pros/cons
        - villager
            + can use magic tools/weapons
        - zombie
            + can respawn with inventory by default
            
    - make it so that charmed mobs can respawn at a set spawn point after death, with the inventories they had when they died.  this is the only
      feasible way i can think of to make it so that charmed mobs could be used for mining.  would also be useful for charmed mobs with other
      types of jobs though (guard duty, bodyguard duty, or whatever).
        - some sort of cost to make a charmed mob start respawning
        - additional cost to make the mob keep its inventory instead of dropping it where it died
        - maybe zombies can get this ability for free to offset their shitty stats and make them feasible as early game miners
              
- next to do:
    
    - add property to Waypoint to track what world it's in
        + add validation to server to make sure all waypoints are in same world when adding a new waypoint
        
    - set a cap on max # of waypoints (ignore new waypoints and show message when right click after cap reached)    
     
    - change the lores and sendMessages in the ItemWaypointRecorder class to use localization, instead of hard-coded english strings
